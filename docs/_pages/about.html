We built Ship.Fail around one simple belief: 👉 Fail fast. Ship faster.

Every abandoned repo, every bug-riddled prototype, every crazy hack that only half-ran — these aren’t embarrassments. They’re the sparks of something bigger. At Ship.Fail, we don’t hide our failures. We celebrate them, because each one brings us closer to what works.
